# Open Peace Finder: Mediation AI Assistant for Geopolitical Conflicts

**Proposed Plan of Action**

Initiate a large-scale AI research project for information aggregation and analysis to find at least 500 non-standard peace agreement options. 

This includes:

* Social graph analysis of all involved stakeholders
* Data mining and data aggregation for statistical and semantic analysis
* Creating a range of possible generative strategies for reasoning and data analysis
* Creation of a full knowledge base and ontology to support the reasoning
* Finding connections and possible ways of resolution
* Identifying key strategies for conflict resolution in the shortest term
* Releasing the created dataset for other explorers
* Generating 50,000-100,000 scenarios with possible further outcomes
* Algorithmically select top 500 peace strategies to present in NATO, US, UK, EU parlamient, Ukraine and Russia.
* Making data publicly available
* Mediation AI Assistant for geopolitical conflicts
